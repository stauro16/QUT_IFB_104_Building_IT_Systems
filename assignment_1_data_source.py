#-----Module Description - Data Set Generation-----------------------#
#
#  This module contains a function needed for Assessment Task 1 in
#  QUT's teaching unit IFB104 "Building IT Systems".  You should put
#  a copy of this file in the same folder as your solution to the
#  assignment.  The necessary element will then be imported
#  into your program automatically.
#
#  NB: Do NOT make any changes to this module and do NOT submit a
#  copy of this file with your solution.  Changes made to this
#  module will have no effect when your assignment is graded because
#  the markers will use their own copy of this file.  If your program
#  relies on changes made to this file it will fail to work when
#  assessed.
#

#-----Preamble-------------------------------------------------------#
#
# This section imports necessary functions used for generating the
# data set.
#

# Import standard Python functions for making "random" choices
from random import randint, choice

#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------#



#-----Data Set Function for Assessing Your Solution------------------#
#
# The function in this section is called by the assignment template
# to generate the data sets used by your program.

# The following function creates a random data set defining the
# overall image to draw.  Your program must work for ANY data set that
# can be produced by this function.  The results returned by calling
# this function will be used as the argument to your data visualisation
# function during marking.  For convenience during code development
# and marking this function also prints the data set generated to the
# shell window.  NB: Your solution should not print anything else to
# the shell.  Make sure any debugging calls to the "print" function
# are disabled before you submit your solution.
#
def raw_data():

    # Define the possible ways the object can move and turn
    moves = ['Move forward', 'Move & turn left', 'Move & turn right']
    # Define the possible initial orientations
    directions = ['North', 'North east', 'South east',
                  'South', 'South west', 'North west']

    # Choose the number of moves
    num_moves = randint(0, 10)
    # Choose the object's initial energy level
    # (which mustn't exceed the number of moves)
    energy = randint(0, num_moves)
    # Choose the object's initial orientation
    direction = choice(directions)

    # Keep track of how many moves have been created in total
    move_no = 0

    # Initialise the data set with the special first move
    random_moves = [[move_no, energy, direction]]

    # Create the remaining moves
    while move_no < num_moves:
        # Increment move number
        move_no = move_no + 1
        # Choose which way the object moves and turns
        move = choice(moves)
        # Add the new move to the data set
        random_moves.append([move_no, move])

    # Print the whole data set to the shell window, laid out
    # nicely, one move per line
    print("The moves to visualise are:\n")
    print(str(random_moves).replace('],', '],\n'))
    
    # Return the data set to the caller
    return random_moves

#
# Some "fixed" data sets
#
# Developing code when the underlying data set changes randomly can
# be difficult.  To help you develop your code you can temporarily
# provide the call to the data generation function at the bottom of
# the assignment template file with a "seed" value which will force
# it to produce a known data set.  Of course, having completed your
# solution, your program must work for any list that can be returned
# by calling the data generation function with no argument.
#
# Some examples of useful seed numbers follow.  Of course, you are
# free to choose other seed values to help you debug your code.
#
# ---------
# Data sets where the object runs out of energy:
#
# 27864 - object faces north but has no energy and attempts
#         no moves

#         attempts no moves

# 89704 - object faces north west but has no energy and
#         doesn't move even though the data set has some
#         moves in it

#         doesn't move even though the data set has some
#         moves in it
