This unit provides a hands-on introduction to computer programming for students with no prior coding experience at all. 
It introduces the basic principles of programming in a typical imperative language, including expressions, assignment, functions, choice and iteration.
It then shows how to use Application Programming Interfaces to complete common Information Technology tasks such as querying databases, creating user interfaces, and searching for patterns in large datasets. 
The emphasis is on developing skills through practice, so the unit includes numerous coding exercises and assignments, using a simple scripting language and code development environment. 
The unit establishes a foundation for later subjects that teach large-scale software development using industrial-strength programming languages.
